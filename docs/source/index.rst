Ringtail
##########
*A tool for handling results from virtual screening of molecules*

Ringtail is an open-source lightweight and highly customizable Python package used to organize, filter, and visualize docking data from virtual screening. Ringtail reads collections of virtual screening results in form of Docking Log File (DLG) from `AutoDock-GPU <https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU>`_, or docking result strings or PDBQT from `AutoDock-Vina <https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-Vina>`_, and inserts them into an SQLite database. It then allows for the filtering of results with numerous pre-defined filtering options, generation of a simple result scatterplot, export of molecule SDFs, and export of CSVs of result data. Result file parsing is parallelized across the user's CPU (or a chosen number) to greatly enhance efficieny of the database writing.

Ringtail comes with a user-friendly :ref:`command line tool <cmdline>` for straight-forward usage, as well as an extensive :ref:`API <api>` for more advanced use in e.g., scripting. 

Ringtail is developed by the `Forli lab <https://forlilab.org/>`_ at the `Center for Computational Structural Biology (CCSB) <https://ccsb.scripps.edu>`_ at `Scripps Research <https://www.scripps.edu/>`_.
