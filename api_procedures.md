### Command line tools for Ringtail 
Should work just as before, but please test them too to make sure I have not made any bugs in my re-write process. 
The one option that is not completely tested yet, is using the config file to add options. This method cannot be trusted to work at the moment. 

### Creating a new ringtail core

A ringtail core is created by instantiating the object with a database. Currently, a database can only be added upon instantiation.
```
rtc = RingtailCore("output.db")
```

Default logging level is "WARNING", and a different logger level can be set at the time of object instantiation.
```
rtc = RingtailCore(db_file="output.db", logging_level="DEBUG)
```

The default docking mode is "dlg", and can be changed to "vina" by accessing the ringtail core attribute `docking_mode`:
```
rtc.docking_mode = "vina"
```

### Adding results
To add results to the database, use the `add_results_from_files` method that takes as input files and directories to upload,
as well as a receptor path and database properties and how to handle the resutls (how many poses to save, how to deal with interactions if having vina results),
and whether or not to print a summary after writing the results to the database.

```
rtc.add_results_from_files( file_path = "test_data/", 
                            recursive = True, 
                            save_receptor = False,
                            max_poses = 3,
                            summary = True)
```

Both files (`filesources_dict`) and processing options (`optionsdict`) can be provided as dictionaries as well or instead of the the individual options. Any provided individual options will overwrite the options provided through dictionaries. 

```
file_sources = {
    "file_path": "test_data/",
    "recursive": True,
}

writeoptions = {
    "store_all_poses": True,
    "max_proc": 4
}

rtc.add_results_from_files( filesources_dict = file_sources,
                            optionsdict = writeoptions,
                            summary = True)
```

A receptor can be added to a database after the fact, using the method `save_receptor`:
```
rtc.save_receptor(receptor_file = "realistic_receptor_name.pdbqt")
```

If at any point you wish to print a summary of the database, the method can be called directly:
```
rtc.print_summary()
```

##### Available options for writing to the database include:

| File options        |Description                                           | Default value   | Requires interactions |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|:----------------|----:|
|file             | DLG/Vina PDBQT file(s) to be read into database                  | no default       ||
|file_path        | Path(s) to files to read into database            | no default       ||
|file_list        | File(s) with list of files to read into database  | no default       ||
|pattern          | Specify pattern to search for when finding files   | \*.dlg\* / \*.pdbqt\* (vina mode)        ||
|recursive        | Flag to perform recursive subdirectory search on file_path directory(s)  | FALSE      ||
|receptor_file | Use with save_receptor and/or add_interactions. Give receptor PDBQT. | None      ||
|save_receptor    | Flag to specify that receptor file should be imported to database. Receptor file must also be specified with receptor_file| FALSE     |<tr><td colspan="5">***Result processing options***</td></tr>
|max_poses        | Number of clusters for which to store top-scoring pose (dlg) or number of poses (vina) to save in database| 3     ||
|store_all_poses  | Flag to indicate that all poses should be stored in database| FALSE      ||
|interaction_tolerance| Adds the interactions for poses within some tolerance RMSD range of the top pose in a cluster to that top pose. Can use as flag with default tolerance of 0.8, or give other value as desired | FALSE -> 0.8 (Ã…)  | Yes |
|add_interactions  | Find interactions between ligands and receptor. Requires receptor PDBQT to be written. | FALSE      ||
|interaction_cutoffs  | Specify distance cutoffs for measuring interactions between ligand and receptor in angstroms. Give as string, separating cutoffs for hydrogen bonds and VDW with comma (in that order). E.g. '3.7,4.0' will set the cutoff for hydrogen bonds to 3.7 angstroms and for VDW to 4.0. | 3.7,4.0     ||
|max_proc | Maximum number of subprocesses to spawn during database writing. | [# available CPUs]      
|append_results      | Add new docking files to existing database given with input_db  | FALSE       ||
|duplicate_handling| Specify how dulicate results should be handled. May specify "ignore" or "replace". Unique results determined from ligand and target names and ligand pose. *NB: use of duplicate handling causes increase in database writing time*| None |
|overwrite        | Flag to overwrite existing database           | FALSE       ||


### Filtering on a database 
To filter results in a database the method `filter` is called on the ringtail core. Filter values can be set directly in the method call:

```
num_ligands_passing_filters = rtc.filter( eworst=-2, 
                                        vdw_interactions=[('A:VAL:279:', True), ('A:LYS:162:', True)])
```

You can also create a dictionary of filters, and pass this to the `filter` method:
```
filters = {
    "ebest":-5.5,
    "hb_interactions": [('A:VAL:279:', True), ('A:LYS:162:', True)],
    "max_miss": 1
}

num_ligands_passing_filters = rtc.filter( filters_dict = filters)
```

Storage and read settings can also be set directly in the method call, for example:
```
num_ligands_passing_filters = rtc.filter( eworst=-2, 
                                        vdw_interactions=[('A:VAL:279:', True), ('A:LYS:162:', True)],
                                        log_file = "experiment424_log.txt",
                                        overwrite = False,
                                        output_all_poses = True)

```

Such settings can be set using a dictionary as well:
```
filters = {
    "ebest":-5.5,
    "hb_interactions": [('A:VAL:279:', True), ('A:LYS:162:', True)],
    "max_miss": 1
}

options = {
    "log_file": "experiment424_log.txt",
    "overwrite": False,
    "output_all_poses": True
}

num_ligands_passing_filters = rtc.filter( filters_dict = filters, options_dict = options)
```

Available filter and options are:

### Using the config file
Both the command line tool and the API can make use of a configuration file, but this option is not fully vetted yet.
